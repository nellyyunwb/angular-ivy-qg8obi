00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.362 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:09:57.981 --> 00:10:02.051 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start

00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:14.214 size:80.00% align:left position:25.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:23.139 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
we'll do a trust exercise.

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:25.258 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:16:06.315 --> 00:16:08.267 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Fine, you babies

00:16:06.315 --> 00:16:08.267 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
can go.

00:16:08.284 --> 00:16:10.069 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Let's go over

00:16:08.284 --> 00:16:10.069 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
to Mommy &amp; Me

00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:14.240 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
and cut holes in the parachute

00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:14.240 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
so it doesn't billow properly.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:16.375 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
(laughs)

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:16.375 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Baby!

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.060 size:80.00% align:left position:20.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
All right, let's move.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:19.078 size:80.00% align:left position:32.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Why aren't you crying?

00:16:19.095 --> 00:16:21.347 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
I was pretending,

00:16:19.095 --> 00:16:21.347 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
and it worked.

00:16:21.364 --> 00:16:22.315 size:80.00% align:left position:42.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Hmm.

00:16:22.331 --> 00:16:25.218 size:80.00% align:left position:30.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
You know, kid,

00:16:22.331 --> 00:16:25.218 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
with your smarts and my Barts,

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:27.086 size:80.00% align:left position:22.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
we make a good team.

00:16:27.103 --> 00:16:28.054 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
What are "Barts"?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.006 size:80.00% align:left position:35.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
You're the smart one,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.006 size:80.00% align:left position:42.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
you figure it out.

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:31.908 size:80.00% align:left position:25.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:34.360 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
I sure hope this book is right.

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:36.412 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.214 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
HOMER:

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.214 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Marge, I'm back.

00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:39.248 size:80.00% align:left position:50.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Sorry, nothing.

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:43.002 size:80.00% align:left position:22.50%,line-left line:79.33%,start
But if we have a third kid,

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:43.002 size:80.00% align:left position:22.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
we should call her Maggie.

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:44.020 size:80.00% align:left position:35.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Why Maggie?

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.088 size:80.00% align:left position:47.50%,line-left line:79.33%,start
It's a good name

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.088 size:80.00% align:left position:50.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
if we lose her.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.090 size:80.00% align:left position:50.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Maggie? Maggie?

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:50.076 size:80.00% align:left position:50.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Going back out.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.812 size:80.00% align:left position:70.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Maggie?

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:58.184 size:80.00% align:left position:15.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
All right, I'm turning to a

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:58.184 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
desperate mother's last resort.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:02.021 size:80.00% align:left position:40.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:17:02.038 --> 00:17:03.956 size:80.00% align:left position:47.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
I hope it works.

00:17:03.973 --> 00:17:05.124 size:80.00% align:left position:27.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Psychic hotline.

00:17:05.141 --> 00:17:07.159 size:80.00% align:left position:55.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Selma? You're

00:17:05.141 --> 00:17:07.159 size:80.00% align:left position:52.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
a psychic now?

00:17:07.176 --> 00:17:09.128 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
I'm filling in

00:17:07.176 --> 00:17:09.128 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:10.947 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
She got hit by a car.

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:12.348 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Never saw it coming.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.232 size:80.00% align:left position:60.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:15.902 size:80.00% align:left position:52.50%,line-left line:79.33%,start
I'll never see

00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:15.902 size:80.00% align:left position:52.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
my kids again.

00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:17.186 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
I'm sensing...

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.021 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
it's all your

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.021 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
husband's fault.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.973 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
That'll be $20.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.241 size:80.00% align:left position:37.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.211 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
I know this place.

00:17:25.228 --> 00:17:28.014 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
It's where Grampa and his

00:17:25.228 --> 00:17:28.014 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
friends the monsters live.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.285 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
I want to pinch 'em.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.238 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Teach me how

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.238 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
to use my phone.

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:39.258 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Stay away from my grandchildren,

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:39.258 size:80.00% align:left position:17.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
you love-sucking ghouls.

00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:41.260 size:80.00% align:left position:20.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:17:43.112 --> 00:17:45.164 size:80.00% align:left position:52.50%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Wait a minute,

00:17:43.112 --> 00:17:45.164 size:80.00% align:left position:52.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
wait a minute.

00:17:45.181 --> 00:17:47.984 size:80.00% align:left position:20.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
I made it out of clay.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.151 size:80.00% align:left position:40.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:50.970 size:80.00% align:left position:45.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Where did you go?

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.039 size:80.00% align:left position:55.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Now, you have

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.039 size:80.00% align:left position:60.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
some candy,

00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:57.276 size:80.00% align:left position:30.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
while I tell the nurses

00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:57.276 size:80.00% align:left position:15.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
station to go get your folks.

00:18:02.148 --> 00:18:04.951 size:80.00% align:left position:42.50%,line-left line:79.33%,start
I guess you should

00:18:02.148 --> 00:18:04.951 size:80.00% align:left position:42.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
be in charge, Lisa.

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:06.085 size:80.00% align:left position:55.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
You'll always

00:18:06.102 --> 00:18:07.853 size:80.00% align:left position:45.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
but you'll always

00:18:06.102 --> 00:18:07.853 size:80.00% align:left position:40.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
be smarter than me.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.057 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Don't worry, Bart, you'll

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.057 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
always think you're in charge,

00:18:11.073 --> 00:18:13.142 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
even though I

00:18:11.073 --> 00:18:13.142 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
secretly will be.

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:14.327 size:80.00% align:left position:55.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Thank you.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.263 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Okay. Listen up,

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.263 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
you childless losers.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.248 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
I need you to help me

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.248 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
find my kids.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.234 size:80.00% align:left position:25.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Any of these them?

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.234 size:80.00% align:left position:42.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Hmm?

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:25.071 size:80.00% align:left position:37.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Uh... no.

00:18:25.087 --> 00:18:26.088 size:80.00% align:left position:32.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
Sorry, kids.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.123 size:80.00% align:left position:30.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
I'll place you

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.123 size:80.00% align:left position:25.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:30.926 size:80.00% align:left position:10.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
but for now, go back to making

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:30.926 size:80.00% align:left position:12.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
those little drink umbrellas.

definitely help you,

00:18:32.328 --> 00:18:33.963 size:80.00% align:left position:22.50%,line-left line:79.33%,start
but, uh, you're gonna

00:18:32.328 --> 00:18:33.963 size:80.00% align:left position:32.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
have to wait.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.148 size:80.00% align:left position:22.50%,line-left line:79.33%,start
We just ordered a pie

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.148 size:80.00% align:left position:32.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:39.385 size:80.00% align:left position:50.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
What'd you do

00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:39.385 size:80.00% align:left position:55.00%,line-left line:84.67%,start
that for?

00:18:39.402 --> 00:18:43.339 size:80.00% align:left position:15.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
Yeah, it took us 45 minutes

00:18:39.402 --> 00:18:43.339 size:80.00% align:left position:22.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:53.299 size:80.00% align:left position:32.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start
A new record.

00:18:53.316 --> 00:18:55.234 size:80.00% align:left position:35.00%,line-left line:79.33%,start
We're lost.

00:18:53.316 --> 00:18:55.234 size:80.00% align:left position:27.50%,line-left line:84.67%,start

00:18:55.251 --> 00:18:58.170 size:80.00% align:left position:47.50%,line-left line:79.33%,start
